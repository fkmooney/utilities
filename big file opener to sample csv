### This can be used to open big files and then save a limited sample as a csv.

                print(line)
                row = [line]
                csv_writer.writerow(row)
                
                count = count + 1
            else: 
                break

output.seek(0) # we need to get back to the start of the BytesIO
df = pd.read_csv(output, header=None)
df.to_csv('output.csv')
